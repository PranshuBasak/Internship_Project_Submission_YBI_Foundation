# Big Sales Prediction
> The "Big Sales Prediction" problem is a typical regression task where the goal is to predict the sales of various products across different outlets. This involves analyzing a dataset containing several features such as `Item_Identifier`, `Item_Weight`, `Item_Fat_Content`, `Item_Visibility`, `Item_Type`, `Item_MRP`, `Outlet_Identifier`, `Outlet_Establishment_Year`, `Outlet_Size`, `Outlet_Location_Type`, and `Outlet_Type`. The target variable is `Item_Outlet_Sales`. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-Squared score. By improving these metrics, we can create a model that accurately predicts sales, helping businesses make informed decisions about inventory management, marketing strategies, and more. This project provides hands-on experience with data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation - all important skills for a data scientist or machine learning engineer.

# MILEAGE PREDICTION- REGRESSION ANALYSIS

> "Mileage Prediction - Regression Analysis" is a project that involves predicting the fuel efficiency (mileage) of a vehicle based on various features such as the make, model, year, engine size, and other specifications. This is a regression problem where the target variable is continuous - the mileage of the vehicle. The dataset contains several features which are analyzed and preprocessed to fit into a regression model. The performance of this model is evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-Squared score. By optimizing these metrics, we aim to create a model that accurately predicts vehicle mileage. This project provides valuable experience in data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, regression modeling, and evaluation techniques.


# Hand Written Digit Prediction Classification Analysis

>The "Hand Written Digit Prediction - Classification Analysis" project is a classic machine learning problem that involves recognizing hand-written digits. In this task, the goal is to predict which digit (0-9) a given image represents. This is a multi-class classification problem where each class corresponds to a digit. The dataset typically used for this problem is the MNIST dataset, which contains images of hand-written digits along with their correct labels. Machine learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are commonly used for this task due to their high accuracy in image classification problems. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. This project provides an excellent opportunity to gain hands-on experience in image processing, deep learning, and classification analysis.
